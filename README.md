# Codeflow
Codeflow is an easy way for project creators or experienced devs to show new contributors how the logic of a program works. 

Every project, especially in dynamic languages, has function calls across files or includes that seemingly come from the void. Finding where these paths lead can be a nightmare especially on large projects. 

Codeflow allows you to say "This function call goes to this file in this location" with 2 button presses. This is then saved to a .codeflow file in your project and when anyone else loads up the project these paths are shown to them so they can navigate around and understand the overall flow much faster than ever before. 

It's currently only available as a plugin for Cloud9 but please feel free to create a plugin for your favorite IDE.
